The holiday commemorates the binding and non-sacrafice of Ishmael (since, in the Koran, it was Ishmael not Issac who was bound), and the Covenant between Abraham and the Lord.\r\n\r\nWhen I learned about Eid, two questions came to mind:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Why don't Jews celebrate any holidays commemorating events that occurred in the book of Genesis?  [It is not really surprising that the religion of Moses takes its cue from the book of Exodus, but I found the omission surprising. However, I am not particularly interested in exploring  answers to this question].</li>\r\n\t<li>Does anyone on this seemingly God forsaken planet remember, never mind commemorate or renew, the covenant between Noah and the Lord?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nRemember the story of Noah in the Bible? Though it is taught widely to children everywhere, I've been surprised at how the rarely it's recalled. (Ed. note: In 2014 Darren Aronofsky (!) will be reminding us all how this went down, with Russel Crowe as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1959490/\">Noah</a>).\r\n\r\nTo recap: God commands Noah to build an ark and collect animal couples, 40 days/nights of rain, a raven, three doves, and an olive branch. Remember how it ends? Why are there so many songs about rainbows?\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/jSFLZ-MzIhM?rel=0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, <sup>9</sup> \"I now establish My covenant with you and your offspring to come, <sup>10</sup> and with every living thing that is with you — birds, cattle, and every wild beast as well — all that have come out of the ark, every living thing on earth. <sup>11</sup> I will maintain My covenant with you: never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.\"</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><sup>12</sup> God further said, \"This is the sign that I set for the covenant between Me and you, and every living creature with you, for all ages to come. <sup>13</sup> I have set My bow in the clouds, and it shall serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. <sup>14</sup> When I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow appears in the clouds, <sup>15</sup> I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature among all flesh, so that the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. <sup>16</sup> When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures, all flesh that is on earth. <sup>17</sup> That,\" God said to Noah, \"shall be the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and all flesh that is on earth.\" <a href=\"http://learn.jtsa.edu/content/translations/noah/torah-portion/noah\">*</a></em></p>\r\nHmm... Sound relevant?\r\n\r\nI just finished reading <em><a href=\"http://www.akpress.org/imperiledlife.html\">Imperiled Life</a>: Revolution Against a Climate Catastrophe</em>, and I am feeling the urgency of this calling.\r\n\r\nI am thinking about starting a campaign that activates the mass communication networks known as organized religions, by short-circuiting the cognitive dissonance between fundamentalism and climate change denial. I want to invoke the Noahide covenant as an on-ramp to help educate religious folks about climate change, in the hopes of transforming their awareness into intention and action. Let's help God keep his word, and hold up our end of the Rainbow!\r\n\r\nAn ambitious goal, to be sure, but we live in dire times. I realize that it might sound like there are logical gaps in this chain of reasoning, but I also believe convincing true believers using scientific reasoning is a dead end. I want to craft a hermeneutic argument, clothed in scripture, to convince the religions of the world to care. I want to turn Earth Day into a religious holiday.\r\n\r\nAnd, I think we might be able to realize (and fund) the first stage of this awareness raising effort through <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZove4OTtI\">merchandising</a>.  I'm imagining rainbow flags, t-shirts, cups, hats, etc, covered with unifying symbol representing the solidarity of world religions. Something along the lines of <a href=\"http://www.coexistfoundation.net/\">Coexist</a>, but more encompassing than just the Abrahamic faiths.  Something closer to the opening image on the <a href=\"http://www.appszoom.com/android_applications/lifestyle/world-festivals-2011_oxo.html\">World Festival app</a>. Maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://alchemicalmusings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sacred_rainbows_flag_concept.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1041\" title=\"sacred_rainbows_flag_concept\" src=\"http://alchemicalmusings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sacred_rainbows_flag_concept-300x234.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" /></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
